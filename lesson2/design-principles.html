            <p>Hick's law, or the Hick-Hyman law, named for the British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision regarding the number of possible choices they have: increase the number of options will increase the decision time logarithmically. The Hick-Hyman law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time required to process a certain number of bits in the Hick-Hyman law is known as the information gain rate.

            <h1>Fitts Law</h1>
            <h2><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=google%2Ccom">google</a> </h2>
            <p><img src="pictures/google.png" width="250" height="400" alt="Profile Picture"></p>
            <p> Fitts' law is a law that, when it comes to interface design, tries to calculate the time needed to move from our current position to a final goal. This is based on the distance to the objective and the size of the area of ​​our final objective mentioned before.
            A good example of this is the most famous search engine of the computer giant, Google, it is a good use and application of this law, since all the buttons that are related to each other are well grouped, with a correct area and within a short distance, of so that the search is fast.</p>
