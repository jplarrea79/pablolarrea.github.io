The Hick-Hyman law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time required to process a certain number of bits in the Hick-Hyman law is known as the information gain rate.

            <p> Fitts' law is a law that, when it comes to interface design, tries to calculate the time needed to move from our current position to a final goal. This is based on the distance to the objective and the size of the area of ​​our final objective mentioned before.
            A good example of this is the most famous search engine of the computer giant, Google, it is a good use and application of this law, since all the buttons that are related to each other are well grouped, with a correct area and within a short distance, of so that the search is fast.</p>
